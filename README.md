# WebDrawExt

Version 4 out! It's pretty much what I hoped for!

# How to set it up:

- Download all the files except this README in a single folder. (Make sure there is nothing else.)

- Go to chrome.

- Go to chrome://extensions

- Turn on developer mode.

- Click "Load Unpacked"

- Select the folder you downloaded the file in!

By now you have finished the setting up of the extension, here's how to use it:

# How to use it:

- Go to any webpage (It won't work in chrome://extensions).

- Click the little puzzle icon on the top right of the page.

- Click 'WebDraw' (Pin it if ya want.)

- A menu will show up. 

- To start drawing, click "Toggle between drawing modes". (To stop drawing, click it again.)

- Draw on the webpage by holding down left/right click!

- Pick a colour from the 10 boxes or the wide box below for a custom colour. (Default is black.)

- Change the slider to format the thickness of the line.

- To clear the canvas, click "Clear".

- Click "Refresh" (After clicking "More") if facing any problems.

Still, don't look at the code... It's a big bodge.

*(For firefox users, just edit the manifest.json and change the value of "manifest_version" to 2 and the label "action" to "browser_action". Everything except the choosing of the custom colour won't work)*
